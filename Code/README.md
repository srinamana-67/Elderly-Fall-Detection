# Elderly Care using Fall Detection Implementing YOLO-V4 Algorithm
## Installation

### Softwares Required
* Python: Language in which code is written
* CMake: For compiling openCV
* Visual Studio Code: For building openCV and darknet code
* Nvidia GPU Driver: For faster GPU performance
* CUDA: For parallel computing using GPU
* CuDNN: A GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks
* OpenCV: For working on images/videos in python
* Darknet: Neural network framework for YOLO

## Fall Detection
### Working
We take the input video from a source and  divide the video into several frames. Now these frames are converted into black and white. On each frame a person is detected using YOLO. 

Now we write the code to draw rectangles on the detected persons. Whenever the height of the rectangle is greater than width of the rectangle Fall is not detected and when width is greater than height Fall is detected.

And this is how we classify the images into a fall and not fall and an alert is generated if a fall is detected.

All of the above process happens for a single frame. Now all of this is set in a loop for each frame of the video and Fall is detected.

### Alert Generation
If the fall is detected in 20 frames of a video simultaneously then an alert is generated by sending an email to the required person. That email also contains the photo of the fall that was detected.
#### [Note-1: Edit the sender's and receiver's email id in ```image_email_fall.py``` file]
#### [Note-2: Make sure that ```2 step verification``` is ```OFF``` and ```less secure app access``` is ```ON``` for your email account]

### Running the script:
```python
python Fall_Detection.py
```
